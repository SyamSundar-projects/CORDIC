# CORDIC
i)It is an iterative method used to implement Trigonometry, Hyperbolic, Linear functions. Using this
algorithm advanced calculator has been designed using the Verilog language. 

ii)Hybrid CORDIC,Redundant Arithmetic CORDIC, Pipelined CORDIC, Radix-4 CORDIC algorithms using the IEEE
papers as references and Perhi textbook.

iii) And I have implemented a novel CORDIC algorithm

There is a presentation on CORDIC to know how cordic uses to do calclations with only shifting and addition without any multiplication.
And I have uploaded codes of
1)sin,cos 
2)muliplication
3)division
4)combinations,permutations
5)squar root
6)logarithm of any base
7)tan inverse
